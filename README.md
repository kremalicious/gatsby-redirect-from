> ðŸŽ¯ Set redirect urls in your YAML frontmatter within your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site's Markdown files. Mimics the behavior of [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from).
> https://kremalicious.com/gatsby-redirect-from/

By adding a `redirect_from` list of URLs to your Markdown file's YAML frontmatter, this plugin creates client-side redirects for all of them at build time, with Gatsby's [`createRedirect`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createRedirect) used under the hood.

By combining this plugin with [gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect](https://github.com/getchalk/gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect), you get simple server-side redirects from your `redirect_from` lists out of the box. You can also combine it with any other plugin picking up Gatsby `createRedirect` calls to get [proper SEO-friendly server-side redirects](https://kremalicious.com/gatsby-redirect-from/#server-side-redirects) for your hosting provider.

## Prerequisites

- Gatsby v2
- Markdown files delivered from [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark)
- `slug` on `allMarkdownRemark.edges.node.fields`

## Installation

```bash
cd yourproject/
npm i gatsby-redirect-from gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect
```

Then load the plugin along with e.g. [gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect](https://github.com/getchalk/gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect) from your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js

]
```

That's it.

```yaml
